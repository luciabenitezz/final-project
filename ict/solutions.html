	<ol><h2>But I’m addicted to fast fashion! What can I do?</h2></ol>
	<ol><p>We need clothes and of course we all want a bargain. But the price is cheap because the producers are not paying the true cost – the harms to <a href="https://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=Papat%C5%AB%C4%81nuku">Papatūānuku.</a>
	We can have a future where fashion pieces are made from toxic-free, sustainable materials, where clothing is designed for longevity and reusability, where every purchase comes with the assurance of fair labour practices, where slow fashion is the norm amidst a fast-paced world. Where fast fashion and its destructive impacts are out of fashion.</p></ol>
	<ol><p>Here are four tips on how to avoid fast fashion: </p></ol>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Recognise</strong> the ads that are targeting you; Convenient cheap disposable clothes are promoted in our social media algorithms.</li>

	<li><strong>Spend</strong> a bit more and invest in clothes you will wear over longer time periods, so you spend less over time. </li>

	<li><strong>Work out</strong> what you really like to wear, not just what is new this year. Maybe this will define your own style! What we wear is an expression of who we are and what we want to say. Our clothes change the way we feel and walk in the world, and the messages we want to share. </li>

	<li><strong>Learn</strong> from how we used to do things. Support manufacturers using natural fabrics that don’t harm Papatūānuku. We can encourage repair and upcycling as a common habit and clothes are kept and appreciated for life. </li>

	<p>If we like good fashion then let’s support local fashion creators and craftspeople!</p>
