<ol><p>Global fast fashion brands are churning out more clothes than the planet can handle. Today’s trends are tomorrow’s trash, with our clothes made cheaply and disposed of quickly. It’s time to stand up for Papatūānuku, to demand sustainable ethical fashion that looks great and feels great at the same time. The rise of fast fashion has had devastating consequences, from its reliance on plastic fabrics and its enormous carbon footprint to its erosion of workers’ rights.
In this article we explain what we mean when we say ‘fast fashion’ and why it is so bad for people and the planet. </p></ol>

	<ol><h2>What is fast fashion?</h2></ol>

	<ol><p>‘Fast fashion’ is what we call the rapid and cheap design, manufacture and marketing of huge (like really HUGE) volumes of clothing. This way of producing garments often uses low-quality materials and exploits low-paid labour in other countries. 

	Fast fashion also refers to an approach to the design and marketing of clothing that emphasises making fashion trends quickly and cheaply. Fast fashion trends appeal to people shopping because they are cheap, stylish and trendy. Fast fashion has an irresistible offer – new shiny clothes at unbelievably low prices. As you can guess, large volumes of low quality garments cause large problems for both people and the environment. So basiclly the goal of fast fashion companies is to encourage people to spend more money on more clothes that they use for a shorter time. That's what makes them money.</ol>
	<hr>
	<ol><h2>Why is fast fashion controversial?</h2></ol>
	<ol><p>The impact of fast fashion on the environment is a layered issue. For starters, a March 2023 report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said that fashion was responsible for up to 10% of annual global carbon emissions. On the production side, overusing oil-based textiles like polyester means that brands rely on fossil fuels to create new products. According to Business of Fashion’s 2023 report, “Oil-based polyester accounts for about 50 percent of fiber production.”In order to produce lots of goods, [brands] want to use the cheapest materials,” Gopinath says. “What is not sustainable then is the system of buying for short-term use and then tossing. And, when it’s poor quality, it starts peeling off microfibers.” Polyester doesn’t biodegrade and sits in landfills and water systems, shedding microfibers over time. These microfibers end up in the water systems.
	Still, overproduction, whether of synthetic fibers like polyester and nylon or natural fibers like cotton, can be an issue. Cotton, for example, is a plant that requires a significant amount of water, fertilizer, and pesticides, with the exception of truly organic cotton.</p></ol>

<ol><h2>Main problems of fast fashion</h2></ol>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Waste:</h3> 85% of all textiles globally go to dumps each year. Landfill dumps are essentially a short term solution as there is only so much space you can put waste. Other supposed alternatives such as incineration, have their own pollution problems. </li>

		<li><h3>Synthetic materials and fossil fuels:</h3> the huge majority of clothes  that corporate companies sell to us are made out of synthetic materials – basically plastic sourced from oil, like polyester or nylon. Every aspect of the process to create these materials involves oil. </li>

		<li><h3>Chemical pollution:</h3> textile dyeing is the world’s second-largest polluter of water, since the water leftover from the dyeing process is often dumped into ditches, streams or rivers.</li>

		<li><h3>Microplastics in ecosystems:</h3>the manufacturing process of clothing products emits microplastics into wastewater, and when washed, tiny microplastics go down the drain and into our waters. In 2021, polyester fiber, a plastic material often used to make clothes, made up approximately 75% of the microplastics found in the Arctic Ocean.</li>

		<li><h3>Wasting water:</h3> 2 billion pairs of jeans are produced every year, and a typical pair takes 7,000 litres of water to produce. For a t-shirt, it takes 2,700 litres of water to make just one – that’s the amount of water an average person drinks over the course of 900 days! </li>

		<li><h3>Human rights abuses in the manufacture:</h3> garment workers frequently work 10 to 16 hour days, six days a week, for nearly three times less than their country’s living wage. 80% of apparel is made by young women between the ages of 18 and 24.</li>

		<li><h3>Clothing colonisation:</h3>shipping textile waste to countries such as Ghana; Ghana is suffering an environmental disaster caused by the fast fashion items we give or throw away.</li>
		
		<p>All of these problems also mean fast fashion is a large contributor to the climate crisis, with estimates that the industry produces between 8–10% of global CO2 emissions.</p>

 		<ol><h2>Which are the leading fast fashion brands?</h2></ol>
 
 		<ol><p>It is important to note that most of the fashion sector has become ‘faster’ in recent years. As such, even the more mainstream, established brands will be ‘fast’ to some extent.What used to be called 'fast' fashion is now called 'ultra fast' fashion. However, there are some brands that stand out as much faster than the rest:
 			<ul>
 			<li>Boohoo, which also owns the following brands: Burton, Coast, Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins, Karen Millen, MissPap, Nasty Gal, Oasis, Pretty Little Thing, Wallis, Warehouse</li>
 			<li>In the Style</li>
 			<li>I Saw It First</li>
 			<li>Shein and missguided</li>
 			<li>Temu</li>
 			<li>Zara</li>
 			<li>H&M</li>
			<ol><p>If a brand is offering vast numbers of ‘new in’ clothes (usually thousands of new items every day) and its products are super cheap, then it is a fast fashion brand.</p></ol>

			<ol><h2>France to ban fast fashion</h2></ol>
			<ol><p>France, with its celebrated and economically significant fashion houses, is taking the political lead in challenging fast fashion.

In March 2024, the French parliament approved a bill that targets fast fashion and ultra-fast fashion sold by online retail giants such as Shein and Temu to counter the fast fashion industry's environmental impact. It makes France the first country in the world legislating to limit the excesses of ultra fast fashion.

It will ban the advertising of certain ultra-fast-fashion companies – and penalise low cost items with a surcharge of €5 (£4.20) an item from 2025, rising to €10 by 2030, to cover their environmental impact. The bill would also mandate that fast fashion retailers include an item's reuse, repair, recycling and environmental impact near the product's price.

The bill states: "This evolution of the apparel sector towards ephemeral fashion, combining increased volumes and low prices, is influencing consumer buying habits by creating buying impulses and a constant need for renewal, which is not without environmental, social and economic consequences."

France will apply criteria such as volumes of clothes produced and turnover speed of new collections in determining what constitutes fast fashion.

“Shein offers 900 times more products than a traditional French brand,” it states, adding that the brand releases more than 7,200 new models of clothing per day, with a total of 470,000 different products available overall.</p></ol>
